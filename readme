This is a temporary space to hold experimental front assembly with shutter for Open Trickler.

Be aware - it is not yet supported by OpenTrickler firmware.

Shutter operation requires two 9g servos (e.g. MG90).
One of the servos needs to be reversed in order for two servos to operate from common PWM signal.

Parts list:
-two mg90 servos and screws that come with them
-four m3 10mm screws to attach servo mounts
-four m3 inserts for the assembly as per Open Trickler project
-one servo reverser or servo revers moddification
-one servo Y cable to join servo cables
