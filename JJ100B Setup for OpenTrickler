JJ100B instruction:
1.Enter scales settings by holding CAL button and powering on the scales.
2.Use CAL to cycle through settings and TARE to change values.
3.Set below values:

C2:1

C6:0

RS232 settings appear opposite in my case. I have tested with multimeter and have straight cable, yet have to use null-modem setting on PCB.

For JJ100B get male-female RS232
